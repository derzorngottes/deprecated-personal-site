When I first decided to switch careers, one of the bootcamps I investigated had the same phrase pop up repeatedly in their marketing materials: 'programmers who love to code so much, they dream in code.'

I find that sort of thing unappealing, because it falls under the umbrella of trying to make programming sound softer/lighter/more fun — an approach that isn't necessary because programming offers enough rewards by itself.

Still, several months into my time at Galvanize I have found that one does indeed dream in code. Here are some of the dreams I have encountered:

#### Puzzle-solving dreams

These are the most aggravating; I had a lot of them earlier in the program. They generally begin with a late night of coding, right up to turning out the light, and leaving off in the middle of trying to solve a problem. (Maybe getting a good grasp on git issues/branching explains the recent lack of them?). Instead of being able to fall properly asleep, I drift in and out of conscious for hours, constantly ruminating on the solution to the problem. However I'm not actually conscious, so the solutions slide around just out of grasp.

#### Abstract dreams

I've only had one of these — in it my dream language was synonymous with computer language and I existed in a fluid electronic state, communicating seamlessly with a group of networked intelligent computers. Like a utopic version of _I have no mouth and I must scream_.

#### Solution dreams

I haven't had one of these (of course) but one of my classmates has. These dreams are similar to the puzzle-solving dreams, except the solution arrives quickly with a bold, pure aesthetic delivery. Must be nice!
