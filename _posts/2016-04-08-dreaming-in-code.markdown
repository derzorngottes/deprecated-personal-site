When I first decided to switch careers, one of the bootcamps I investigated had the same phrase pop up repeatedly in their marketing materials: 'programmers who love to code so much, they dream in code.'

I find that sort of thing unappealing, because it falls under the umbrella of trying to make programming sound softer/lighter/more fun â€” an approach that isn't necessary because programming offers enough rewards by itself.

Still, several months into my time at Galvanize I have found that one does indeed dream in code. Here are some of the dreams I have encountered:

#### Figuring dreams

These are the most aggravating; I had a lot of them earlier in the program. They generally begin with a late night of coding, right up to turning out the light, and leaving off in the middle of trying to solve a problem. (Maybe git issues/branching explain the recent lack of them?). Instead of being able to fall properly asleep, I drift in and out of conscious for hours, constantly ruminating on the solution to the problem. However I'm not actually conscious, so the solutions slide around just out of grasp.

#### Abstract dreams

I've only had one of these.

#### Solution dreams

I haven't had one of these (of course) but one of my classmates has.
