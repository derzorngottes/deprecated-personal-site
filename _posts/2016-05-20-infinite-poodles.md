title: Schopenhauer's Infinite Poodles
---
I learned yesterday that the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer kept a succession of standard poodles as his only companions during his final 27 years in Frankfurt. Each poodle had the same name, Atma, derived from the Sanskrit word Ä€tman of Hindu philosophy, meaning the fundamental essence of the individual beyond physical phenomena.

These poodles were Schopenhauer's closest companions, and when one died he would immediately procure another. In this way Schopenhauer exercised his own version of the Platonic theory of forms.

While researching the above I stumbled on a German idiom: 'the _core of the poodle_':  

>In early modern Germany black poodles were considered to be consorts of the devil. In Goethe's _Faust_ the learned Doctor Faust takes in a stray black poodle, actually Mephistopheles in disguise. In Part I Mephistopheles is tortured as Faust debates aloud how to translate the opening line of John's Gospel. After taking various fantastic shapes, as Faust conjures, at line 1323 Mephistopheles finally transforms into a travelling scholar, at whose appearance Faust says: 'So that was the core of the poodle.'
