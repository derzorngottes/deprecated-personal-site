title: An Indigenous Peoples' History of the Unites States by Roxane Dunbar-Ortiz
---

I've finally had time to dig into this fantastic book over the Q2 break week. I was looking for a book _like this_ for a long time before I learned about this one. (I thought David Stannard's _American Holocaust_ might be it, but it came out in 1994 and the wealth of research into indigenous North and South American cultures conducted since then must be enormous. Still on my list though.)

In her introduction to _An Indigenous Peoples' History_ Dunbar-Ortiz writes:

> This book attempts to tell the story of the United States as a colonialist settler-state, one that, like colonialist European states, crushed and subjugated the original civilizations in the territories it now rules. Indigenous peoples, now in a colonial relationship with the United States, inhabited and thrived for millennia before they were displaced to fragmented reservations and economically decimated.
This is a history of the United States.

She opens with an overview of early American nations and cities, including Cahokia, located in present-day Missouri, which circa 1250 AD (some sources say 1100) had a greater population than London — approximately 40,000 people; shortly after that, some time during the 1300s, Cahokia declined and its population dispersed. She also briefly mentions the Hohokam, who during roughly the same time period, constructed a series of canals as part of a large irrigation system near modern-day Phoenix.

Although I was already cognizant of the great silence in mainstream US history regarding Native American cultures, this chapter really underscored to me the enormity of what must be missing from our understanding of human civilization on this continent. Learning about the ancient cities in quick succession felt like finding a secret door in a familiar house, opening it and finding an entirely new set of rooms.

From further reading, I've learned:
* there exists very little information and/or research on indigenous American cultures prior to European arrival
* of what exists, published accounts contain conflicting narratives with few source notes/bibliographies
* lots of published accounts aggrandize or prioritize European figures/European accounts, even where indigenous accounts are available

I grew up in England, and spent much of my childhood learning about the ancient cultures of Europe — the Greeks, the Romans, the Gauls, the Angles, the Saxons, the Pagans, etc., etc. It's shocking how little information is available on their American contemporaries, and how much of what we do know is filtered through colonial lenses, whether they be the fragmented writings of Spanish conquistadors or the accounts of colonial American historians.

Dunbar-Ortiz mentions in her introduction that she relied primarily on indigenous sources/histories to create this book. If so, I expect and look forward to discovering more of the fascinating and tragic history of this country.
