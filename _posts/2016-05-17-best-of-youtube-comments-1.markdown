title: Best of Youtube comments, part 1

The Youtube comment system, widely recognized as one of the internet's many cesspits, still manages to produce glimmers of charming idiosyncracy.

>I first heard this song in early or mid 1978.   Had been out drinking with friends and only got about 3 hours of sleep before I had to get to work at the shipyard where I worked then.  Was late for work... barreling down the streets like Haley's comet... and this song came on.  Revelation city!  I can still remember saying to myself "This is FANTASTIC!  I can't BELIEVE this!"  Went down to the record store and bought it the next day... and as Brian Eno or Georgio Moroder or whoever it was said at the time:  "I've heard the 'music of the future!''

>The funny thing about this "techno" song however, is, that the first time I heard it, the vocals (primarily) reminded me of Ancient Greek music!  I'm a bit of a self-educated "musical scholar"... and the "remote" quality of the vocals reminded me of certain ancient techniques... Or maybe I'm grasping at straws; not sure.  Whatever:  There is something TIMELESS about this song and it has the "fingerprints" of Eternity on it!

>If "space aliens" ever arrived at my door and demanded proof that we are a species worthy of being allowed to exist, I'd present this song to them (among other treasures of Human achievement; among them Michelangelo, Da Vinci, the Impressionists, Debussy, and a few others...)  YES!  I would say;  we are a "sacred" species, for we created THESE!

>Viva le Discotheque!  What a great time to be in your early 20's!  Wish I could go back!
