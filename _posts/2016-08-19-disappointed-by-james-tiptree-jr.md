title: Disappointed by James Tiptree Jr
---
Over the weekend I went to a wedding. It was a short trip so I took a short book: *Houston, Houston, Do You Read?* by James Tiptree Jr, an early female science fiction writer. I was eager to read it because several sources had placed her in the same company as Anna Kavan and Joanna Russ, two writers whose work embodies philosophical science fiction.

The premise of *Houston* is more hardboiled than either *Ice* by Kavan (whose work is decidedly Kafka school; even her science fiction work is more surreal than scientific) or *We Who Are About To...* by Russ. A group of men are traveling on a space ship when they receive a strange transmission from a remote ship. As they get closer they make contact, and the ship turns out to be captained and manned almost entirely by women who inform the men that they have somehow arrived a few hundred years into the future, and that their old lives and Earth as they left it are gone forever.

The men, who presumably left Earth in the 21st century, rigidly adhere to the social stereotypes of the 60s. There is the womanizer, the religious family man, and the analytical doctor. They are bemused by the female crew, and each plots their manifest destiny of re-conquering Earth in his own way.

One broad sentiment about this work is that supposedly, when was published, the largely male audience took these characters at surface value, identified with them, and enjoyed the work as a brief hypothetical story of masculine vs feminine.

The new way to read it, we are told, is by critically observing the male characters and their attitudes about gender. The problem is, this angle isn't enough to sustain any kind of serious intellectual engagement. Although subversive for its time, the concepts of "men always judge women to be inferior," "men seek to own and subjugate women" and "women might be better at running the world than men" are a little too on-the-nose for contemporary consideration. One consistent feature of engaging novels is the imprecise thought patterning of the protagonist, via which the author can move through and draw together disparate concepts into a cohesive vision. *Houston* does not achieve this, its focus rarely departing the gender wars.
