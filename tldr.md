hi, i'm amy. i am a writer, programmer, musician, and 3D artist,

my work interrogates questions of identity, ethics, consciousness, culture, and dreams. i am most interested in bridging the gap between technology and the arts, and identifying ways that technology can be used to serve vulnerable populations.

you can find my latest work [here](projects.md).
