Hi. I'm a full stack developer in Seattle.

You can see some of my recent work [here](https://github.com/derzorngottes).

&&

I've collected several online handles:

kavanorama — this name references the midcentury writer Anna Kavan, whose novel ICE remains criminally unknown

elrey — an anonymous shorthand

derzorngottes — references the film AGUIRRE DER ZORN GOTTES by Werner Herzog (thoughts [here](https://)).
