Hi. I'm a full stack developer in Seattle. You can see some of my recent work [here](https://gist.github.com/derzorngottes/f4c82fb0ef08689516748a48ec914104).

I dabble in photography and music (primarily synthesis and the theremin). I used to write fiction. I still do, but I used to, too.

1.

The blog title 'unquestioning thought' comes from Robert Walser's 1917 novella _Der Spaziergang_ (_The Walk_):

> As I looked at earth and air and sky the melancholy unquestioning thought came to me that I was a poor prisoner between heaven and earth, that all men were miserably imprisoned in this way ...

Although I'm sure it seems dramatic, it was the shortest clip I could find from Walser's vast and largely irreverent body of work.

I've collected several online handles:

kavanorama — this name references the midcentury writer Anna Kavan, whose novel ICE remains criminally unknown

elrey — an anonymous shorthand

derzorngottes — references the film AGUIRRE DER ZORN GOTTES by Werner Herzog (thoughts on that in a post TK).
